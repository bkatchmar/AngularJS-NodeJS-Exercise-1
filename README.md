# AngularJS-NodeJS-Exercise-1
The main purpose of this repo is to help get my teammates up to speed when it comes to using AngularJS, which is very relevant in our current line of work.

I have asked the team to first follow [this link](https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2016/06/22/nodejs-setup-simple-http-server-local-web-server) in order to get some needed technologies to make the development environment easy and seamless.

I am using NodeJS to get some lightweight server side handling going on and ran this command:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Running the command is done with this:

```
http-server
```
